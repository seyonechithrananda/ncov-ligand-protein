# ncov-ligand-protein
ncov-ligand-protein: A collection of models (Graph Attention Networks, Graph Convolutional Networks, Message Parsing Neural Networks, Random Forest Classifiers) trained for predicting activity across molecular assays for the 3clpro protease in SARS-CoV-2. 

The repo currently consists primarily of graph-based models trained on molecular assays for the 3cl-pro protease of SARS-CoV-1, which is believed to be highly homologous to the 3cl-pro protease in SARS-CoV-2 (96% structural similarity). Model performance is consistently evaluated on predicting inhibition for SARS-COv-2. The models are trained on molecular 3CLpro inhibition assays provided by the MIT J-Clinic (https://www.aicures.mit.edu/data). 

Models are a work in progress, and are not recommended for using in a clinical setting.
